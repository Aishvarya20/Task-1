Project Description: The Simple Calculator Tool is a Java-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It features four primary functionalities:

Addition: Calculates the sum of two numbers.
Subtraction: Computes the difference between two numbers.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.

Key Features:
Addition:
Functionality: Adds two input numbers.
Inputs: Two numbers.
Output: The sum of the numbers.

Subtraction:
Functionality: Subtracts one number from another.
Inputs: Two numbers.
Output: The difference between the numbers.

Multiplication:
Functionality: Multiplies two numbers.
Inputs: Two numbers.
Output: The product of the numbers.

Division:
Functionality: Divides one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.
Inputs: Two numbers.
Output: The quotient of the numbers or an error message if division by zero occurs.

Code Structure:
SimpleCalculator.java:
Main Class: Contains the core logic for the application.
Methods:
main(String[] args): Manages user interaction and invokes calculations.
add(double num1, double num2): Performs addition.
subtract(double num1, double num2): Performs subtraction.
multiply(double num1, double num2): Performs multiplication.
divide(double num1, double num2): Performs division with error handling.
Usage Instructions:
Save the Code: Save the code in SimpleCalculator.java.

Compile: Use javac SimpleCalculator.java to compile.

Run: Execute with java SimpleCalculator and follow the prompts.
Potential Enhancements:
Extended Operations: Add advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square roots, exponentiation).

User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.

Error Handling: Improve error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases.
This project lays the foundation for basic arithmetic applications and provides a platform for further enhancements. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work on this and for the guidance from my mentor, Muzammil Ahmed.
